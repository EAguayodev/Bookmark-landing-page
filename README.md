### What I learned


### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration](Mozilla) - I used the MDN resource to help myself out with choosing to either use the foreach and for loop concept to achieve the open and close toggle for the FAQ menu. Another helpful idea that came from the resource was using let to assigned arrays for displaying the different bookmarks provided.
